# LocalChatBot

Local Chat Bot is a simple python flask application to interact in a chatbot way with your preferred models imported in Ollama.

## Installation

You will need :
- Python
- A bunch of python library : json, os, time, langchain, flask, langchain_ollama
- Ollama : https://ollama.com/download/linux
- You're prefered Ollama model : https://ollama.com/library

Paste the script and the template where you want, launch it and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
That's all. 
Start discussing with your model without needing chatGPT accounts, giving all your information to GAFAM, etc...

P.S.: You can update the template to suits your preference and certainly do better than this
P.P.S: The template was generated partly by llama3 using this script (Ascii ART, CSS, etc...)

## Usage 

Ask your question, get your answer and if you want to switch subject, check the "Forget previous conversations and start a new one" checkbox.
Again that's all.

## Improvement

Maybe. Who knows?

## Thanks to
This script is based on the wonderful work made here : https://blog.devops.dev/local-gen-ai-chatbot-with-memory-using-ollama-llama3-using-python-3e07f4057cad

Basically, I just added a web interface to it (and certainly in a poor way) but it works! :D
